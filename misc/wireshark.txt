(1. "Can we talk?", 2. "Yep", 3. "Great")

2. 44574
3. The computer has lots of processes happening and needs this information to be send to the right one

5. Daytime: \n60201 23-09-14 15:10:39 50 0 0 567.7 UTC(NIST) * \n
   We can see date (23-09-14, yy-mm-dd) and time (15:10:39, hh:mm:ss). We see time zone (UTC) and source (NIST).  I can't figure out what the last number is-it seems to vary wildly
6. Syncronize--request to connect
7. Acknowledge--says OK
8. Finished--says we're done talking
9. The nc client. We see a FIN request sent from my IP to the daytime server (which sends an ACK back):

===== HTTP =====

1. Two TCP connections were opened. Two TCP handshakes happen at once at the very start, on from port 41172 and one from port 41178. The first 4 messages are the only [SYN] messages so there can't be more handshakes.

===== QUESTIONS =====
-What are all the interactions that happen after the head is sent? like
	34	21.630574194	45.79.89.123	192.168.116.128	TCP	60	[TCP Keep-Alive ACK] 80 → 41172 [ACK] Seq=80336 Ack=324 Win=64240 Len=0
-What were the other numbers in the Daytime protocol?
-Why were there two TCP handshakes for loading the webpage from different ports?
